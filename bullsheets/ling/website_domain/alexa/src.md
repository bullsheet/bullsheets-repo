Notes: the original files has 1 000 000 lines, but after some tests, it was unnecessarily slow (1-2 seconds of waiting),
so I reduced it to the current size, and there is no noticeable waiting now.

(note: I did choose the number of 4064 randomly, maybe I could have a higher number without noticeable wait time...)
